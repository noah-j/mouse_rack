# mouse_rack

I am working on this simple program in Tkinter to learn more about python 2.7. The mouse rack program is intended to help 
lab workers who are responsible for mouse husbandry keep track of what's in their mouse room and keep up on deadlines
related to their cages.

NOTE 7/21/15: I have abandonded this project. The time investment isn't worth the resultant program. It could be useful if it was integrated with a barcode scanner and cage specific barcodes but that's way beyond my means.
